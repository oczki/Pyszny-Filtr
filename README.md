# Pyszny-Filtr
Allows filtering liked and disliked ingredients on Pyszne.pl.

You can enter multiple ingredients by separating them with a comma.

- Entering `ceb, ruko` in "chcę to, to, ..." will show meals that have **both** "cebula" **and** "rukola".
- Entering `ceb, ruko` in "nie chcę, bleh, ..." will show meals that have **neither** "cebula" **nor** "rukola".
